            <p>His name was Sergey, he was from France and every year he came to visit relatives. His grandfather somehow accidentally knocked over a jar of white paint on me, and after that incident Seryozha fell in love with me. That day he apologized to me for a long time, we washed my clothes from this crappy paint, which did not want to wash off. During these few hours, I managed to learn almost all the swear words in French. We spent the rest of the summer together, secretly meeting at night and walking all day. On my 14th birthday, he gave me a dog that lives with me to this day. We broke up after 2 years of friendship and six months of very strong relations. Then he sent me an invitation letter to his wedding.</p>
